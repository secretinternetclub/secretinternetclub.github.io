However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party, including a government, request to disclose your information.</p>
<h3>Business Transfers and Affiliates</h3>
<p>In the event that FanPeeks is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction.

<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <a href="http://206.189.95.177/privacy">http://206.189.95.177/privacy</a>.
